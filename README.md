KNN, Kernel Regression, and PCA Analysis

This project implements three core machine learning techniques from scratch:

K-Nearest Neighbors Classification

Kernel Regression with Polynomial, RBF, and Custom Kernels

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with Eigenvector Visualization

The datasets are provided as .pkl files and include synthetic classification data, regression surfaces, and image data for dimensionality reduction.

1. KNN Classification

Implements K-Nearest Neighbors from scratch:

Euclidean distance

Custom “kernelized distance”

Majority-vote prediction

Accuracy evaluation

Accuracy curves for K = 1 to 25

Visualization:
Test accuracy vs. K for both distance metrics.

2. Kernel Regression

Implements three kernel functions:

Polynomial kernel

RBF (Gaussian) kernel

Custom kernel:

Includes:

Kernel matrix computation

Weighted regression

2D scatter visualizations of ground-truth vs. predicted surfaces

MSE calculation

Hyperparameter sweeps (degree, gamma)

Also includes an LSH-accelerated kernel regressor:

Random Gaussian projections

Approximate nearest neighbors

Runtime comparison

Quality vs. speed visualization

3. PCA & Eigenvector Visualization

Performs PCA manually using the "transpose trick":

Centering

Covariance via 
𝑋
𝑋
⊤
XX
⊤
 (because 
𝑁
<
𝑑
N<d)

Eigenvalue decomposition

Transformation back to original space

Visualization of first 10 eigenvectors (as 28×28 images)

These eigenvectors represent principal directions in the dataset (similar to eigenfaces).

Technologies Used:

Python

NumPy

Matplotlib

Scikit-learn (for LSH baseline only)
